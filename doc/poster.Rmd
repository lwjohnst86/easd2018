Fatty acids between the two circles indicate that they have a strong correlation to the scores. A fatty acid with a strong positive correlation suggests that a higher concentration of the fatty acid has a higher component score, therefore associating with a higher LHR or Height.

**Aims**:
Adverse early childhood conditions have been associated with greater risk for
adult chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease.
However, the specific mechanism of action is not well understood. Adult relative
leg length is a potential biomarker of early childhood conditions. Our aim was
to identify potential groups or patterns of fatty acids that relate to height or
leg length.

**Methods**:
Canadian adults (n=453) at risk for T2DM from the Prospective
Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort had detailed personal and
metabolic data collected.  Serum fatty acid concentrations (nmol/mL) were quantified at
the baseline visit (2004-2006) for 22 fatty acids in the cholesteryl ester (**CE**),
phospholipid (**PL**), triacylglycerol (**TG**), and non-esterified (**NE**) lipid
fractions. Height and sitting height were measured, which were used to compute
leg to height ratio (**LHR**). Sitting height was only measured at the 3-year
follow-up visit. To identify groupings in the fatty acid profile, we used the
supervised dimensionality reduction method partial least squares (PLS) with the
stature components as the constraining variables and the fatty acids as the
predictor variables. Two separate models were analyzed, one each for height and
LHR.

**Results**:
In the PLS model with LHR (Figure 2A), the first component was positively loaded only by
20:5 n-3, 22:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 while the second component was negatively loaded
by e.g. 14:0, 16:0, and 16:1 n-7. For height (Figure 2C), the first component
only loaded negatively with 16:1 n-7 while the second component by various 18,
20, and 22 chain fatty acids. An example interpretation of the loadings is that,
for Figure 2A, one standard deviation increase in PL 22:6 n-3 contributes to the
LHR C1 score by 0.27. The fatty acids that contributed substantially to the
explained variance for LHR (Figure 2B) and that grouped together were the 14,
16, and 18 chain fatty acids, while no fatty acids contributed strongly in the
height model (Figure 2D).

**Conclusions**:
Longer adult relative leg length, but not height, associated with a distinct
lipid profile in late adulthood. This profile reflected more omega-3 long chain
fatty acids and less of the 14 and 16 carbon long fatty acids. This results seem
to indicate that early childhood conditions, as reflected in adult leg length,
may subtly influence lipid production and usage in late adulthood.

### Basic characteristics of the PROMISE cohort at the baseline visit {data-height=45}

```{r tab_basics}
project_data %>% 
    filter(VN == 0) %>% 
    mutate(Sex = factor(Sex)) %>% 
    outline_table() %>% 
    add_rows(c("Sex", "Ethnicity"), stat_nPct) %>% 
    add_rows(c("Age", outcome_vars[c(1, 4)], "BMI", "Waist"), stat_medianIQR, digits = 2) %>% 
    renaming("rows", function(x) stringr::str_replace(x, "Ethnicity", "Ethnicity/ancestry") %>% 
                 stringr::str_replace("LegHtRatio", "LHR^1^")) %>% 
    renaming("header", c("Characteristics", "Values")) %>% 
    build_table(alignment = "right")
```

Note: Values are in n (%) or median (interquartile range). 1) Only LHR was
measured at the 3rd year follow-up visit. All others were measured at the
baseline visit.
